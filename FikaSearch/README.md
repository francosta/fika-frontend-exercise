##Â Introduction

This is my solution for the Fika frontend technical challenge.

## Running the project

In order to run the project, run `yarn` to install dependencies and then `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to run it with our emulator of choice.

This project was initialized with Expo, which means you can also easily run it in your real device. To do so, run `yarn start` in the terminal and, with the Expo Go app, scan the QR code provided in the browser. This will build the application to your device.
